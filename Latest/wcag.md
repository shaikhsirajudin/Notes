# What are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines?
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines(WCAG), Produced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the WCAG are the best means of making your website useful to all of your users.
They are not an all-inclusive list of issues facing web users with disabilities, these are internationally recognised and adopted standards. The guidelines explain how to solve many of the problems that your users with disabilities face.
There are two version of WCAG 
1) WCAG 1.0 in 1999
2) WCAG 2.0 in 2008
3) WCAG 2.1 is currently in development and is scheduled to be published as a standard in 2018.

Both the WCAG 2.0 and the older WCAG 1.0 are further organized into priority levels, ranging from most important (A) to least important (AAA). At Penn State, Web sites should fulfill levels A and AA to be considered compliant.


# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 had 14 guidelines and divided them into 3 priority levels:
◾Priority 1 – the most basic level of web accessibility
◾Priority 2 – addressed the biggest barriers for users with disabilities
◾Priority 3 – significant improvements to web accessibility

# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0
WCAG 2.0 is a stable, referenceable technical standard. It has 12 guidelines that are organized under 4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. For each guideline, there are testable 61 success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA.
The guidelines are more technologically neutral than WCAG 1.0, allowing them to stay useful for longer.By designing WCAG 2.0 around principles and not technology, the W3C created an ethical statement as well as useful guidance.
The principles of WCAG 2.0 are:
 * Perceivable
 * Operable
 * Understandable
 * Robust

# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1
WCAG 2.1 is designed to be "backwards compatible" so websites that conform to WCAG 2.1 will also conform to WCAG 2.0 — which means that a website that meets WCAG 2.1 will meet the requirements of policies that reference WCAG 2.0.


# Perceivable
Web content should be made available to the senses - sight, hearing, and/or touch
Examples of Principle 1
```
•Visually impaired users must be able to receive information via sound or touch
•Hearing impaired users must be able to receive information via sight 
•Low vision users must be able to receive information with alternative formatting or zoomed to larger sizes
•Color deficient users must be able to receive information without use of color

```

# Operable
interface components/forms, controls, and navigation are operable

Examples of Principle 2:
```
•Functions triggered via mouse or gesture are also available via a keyboard
•All users are given sufficient time to read and use content.
•Content does not induce seizures.
•Users are given mechanisms to skip repetitive content.
•Landmarks are provided to assist in screenreader navigation (e.g. meaningful page title, semantic headings, ARIA landmarks) meaningful headers and meaningful and unique link text.
•Multiple paths are provided to navigate Web site structure.
```

# Understandable
Information/Content and the operation of user interface must be understandable.

Examples of Principle 3:
```
•Site is free of unannounced pop up windows.
•Separate Submit or Go buttons/links are provided to initiate page changes (versus autosubmit upon selection).
•Navigation and labels are consistent across a Web site or application.
•Mechanisms are available to detect errors and provide clear instructions to users on fixing errors.
•Language of text or subsection of text is identified.

```

# Robust
Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
